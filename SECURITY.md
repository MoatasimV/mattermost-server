Security
========

Safety and data security is of the utmost priority for the TAKWEN DOcommunity. If you are a security researcher and have discovered a security vulnerability in our codebase, we would appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner.

Reporting security issues
-------------------------

**Please do not use GitHub issues for security-sensitive communication.**

Security issues in the community test server, any of the open source codebases maintained by Mattermost, or any of our commercial offerings should be reported via email to [responsibledisclosure@takwen.co/do](mailto:responsibledisclosure@takwen.co/do). TAKWEN DOis committed to working together with researchers and keeping them updated throughout the patching process. Researchers who responsibly report valid security issues will be publicly credited for their efforts (if they so choose).

For a more detailed description of the disclosure process and a list of researchers who have previously contributed to the disclosure program, see [Report a Security Vulnerability](https://takwen.co/do/security-vulnerability-report/) on the TAKWEN DOwebsite.
